            <h3>After Class</h3>
            <p>After Class is a project developed in collaboration with colleagues as part of a college course. The goal of this project is to create a content-sharing application focused on professionals and students in the field of computing. The platform allows users to publish, share, and access educational and professional materials, promoting the exchange of knowledge and resources.</p>
            <p> For the frontend, we used React, which enabled us to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. On the backend, we employed Java with Spring Boot, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture for the application. In this project, I worked primarily on the backend, developing essential features for the application, such as tag filters. The project was highly appreciated by the professors, earning a score of 9 out of 10.</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning Project</h3>
            <p>This project was part of a machine learning course. The objective was to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on certain attributes, evaluating the accuracy of various algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks, and regression. I achieved an accuracy of around 80%, which was considered the upper limit for this project. In this project, I used Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.</p>

            <h3>Internship at Praso</h3>
            <p>Praso is a startup based in Brazil that aims to help small and medium-sized businesses purchase cheaper products with quality service and delivery. When I started at Praso, the company did not store information about deliveries. The deliveries were managed by another application called Routeasy, and we did not save this information in our database. My project involved creating the entire process for saving these delivery details, which included designing tables and integrating with Routeasy. By the end of the project, we were successfully storing the most important delivery information.</p>

            <h3>Informatics Instructor at Medalhei</h3>
            <p>Medalhei is a platform for high school students with the goal of preparing them for knowledge olympiads. I was selected to start the project in the field of informatics, where I prepared materials and recorded video lessons, helping the students to prepare for the bralizian olympiad in informatics. </p>

            <h3>Colégio Motiva</h3>
            <p>I completed my elementary and high school education at Colégio Motiva in João Pessoa. During this period, I always enjoyed participating in scientific olympiads, earning over 20 awards in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, astronomy, and robotics. Additionally, I was a member of the school's handball team, where we became national school champions.</p>

            <h3>Universidade Federal de Campina Grande</h3>
            <p>I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Campina Grande, one of the best universities in Brazil for IT. I had the opportunity to learn from excellent professors, participate in extension projects, and be part of the Olympic Project. I qualified twice for the ICPC World Finals and was also a Brazilian ICPC champion. Additionally, I was a teaching assistant for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, where I taught topics such as graphs, dynamic programming, and complexity analysis for two semesters.</p>
            <p>I finished the course with the preparation of my thesis, which was in the field of algorithms, specifically focusing on maximum flow algorithms and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. The work was praised by my professors and received a score of 9.5 out of 10.</p>

            <h3>ICPC</h3>
            <p>The ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) is the world's foremost programming competition for university students. I participated in the ICPC four times, and in two of those, I qualified for the national finals: the 2020 edition, which was held online in 2021 due to the pandemic, and the 2021 edition, which took place in 2022 in the city of Gramado.</p>
            <p>In the 2020 Brazilian Finals, we achieved an unprecedented title for our university and consequently qualified for the world finals. In the 2021 edition, we secured sixth place, which qualified me for my second world finals. The world finals were held in 2022 and 2024 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Luxor, Egypt, respectively.</p>
